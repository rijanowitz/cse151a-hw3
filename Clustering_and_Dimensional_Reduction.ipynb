For instance, if we calculate the distance formulas for the bitstrings 0000 and 0110, euclidean distance gives us 1.414, cosine distance gives us a divide by zero issue, and manhattan distance gives us 2, which is the accurate \"distance\" for these bitstrings.\n",

For Agglomerative, this happens because we have many bitstrings that form a cluster/equivalence class in clusters 25 - 31. There are very few bitstrings that do not form a cluster together as defined by Manhattan distance + single linkage. This seems like a much more accurate way of grouping into equivalence classes because we want bitstrings that are equivalent to be grouped together like this. In K-means, the point is to optimize variance around a centroid, not to necessarily mimic the actual equivalance class of a bitstring."
