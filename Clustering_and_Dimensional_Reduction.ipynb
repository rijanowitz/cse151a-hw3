        "### Exercise 1.2 - Agglomerative Clustering for Equivalence Classes (15 points)\n",
        "\n",
        " - Perform the agglomerative clustering with the parameters you picked in the above three questions.\n",
        " - Show the frequency(number of members) of each cluster. You are encouraged to create a bar chart to show the distribution as it will help you in Exercise 2, but printing only the numbers is also fine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hints:\n",
        " - The value of ```distance_threshold``` in the arguments should be **slightly** higher than what you picked. This is because we only merge two clusters when their distance is **strictly smaller** than the threshold."
